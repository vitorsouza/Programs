/**
 * Reads a CSV file with the result of the 1st filter of a systematic mapping search, selecting those who have been
 * marked as OK and writing them into a new CSV file for the next step of the process.
 * 
 * To use this script, you should provide a file called sysmap-1stfilter.csv with the results of the 1st filter of the
 * mapping. The script expects this file to have a title row as first column and to have the following columns, in this
 * order: ID; year; source; title; analysis. Moreover, the analysis column should start with OK for publications that
 * will pass the filter and anything else for publications that will be cut out.
 * 
 * I created this script to automate some steps of a systematic literature mapping / systematic literature review
 * processes. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review.
